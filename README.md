[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](teaser.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH_EW0l6Q8M)

This repository provides the Pytorch code for our work accepted to [BMVC 2021](https://www.bmvc2021.com/) as an Oral Presentation.

Code repository with demo script for the NTU-60 dataset.

## Requirements
+ TO BE COMPLETED.

The code has been runned on PyTorch version ?? and we therefore recommend this version.

For any questions, feel free to contact giancarlo.paoletti@iit.it
